# Enhanced Vocabulary Trees for Real-Time Object Recognition in Image and Video Streams

This project explores the application of k-Means clustering trees in the field of computer vision, focusing on the influential work by Nister and Stewenius (CVPR 2006) and its extensions. The primary objective is to investigate the effectiveness and efficiency of this approach for visual recognition tasks. The study delves into the hierarchical structure of k-means clustering trees and evaluates their impact on recognition accuracy and computational efficiency. The research methodology involves an in-depth analysis of the original work and subsequent literature, along with implementing a program design based on the proposed methodology. The design includes steps such as dataset installation, feature detection using the ORB detector, k-means clustering, max voting, cluster reassignment, and noise calculations.
To evaluate the performance of the approach, experiments are conducted using publicly available datasets, with plans to explore larger datasets such as COCO. The research also considers the exploration of alternative feature detectors and clustering algorithms like minimal cut and grab cut, aiming to reduce noise and achieve higher accuracy. The findings of this research contribute to greater understanding of k-means clustering trees in computer vision and provide insights into their practical implementation. By comparing the results with the original research paper and exploring different methodologies, the study seeks to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of this approach and inspire further advancements in the field.
